      <p>Outkast (sometimes written as OutKast) was an American hip hop duo formed in 1992 in East Point, Georgia,
        consisting of Atlanta-based rappers André "3000" Benjamin (formerly known as Dré) and Antwan "Big Boi"
        Patton. Widely recognized for their intricate lyricism, memorable melodies and positive messages, Outkast
        is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential hip hop acts of all time.The duo
        achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to
        popularize Southern hip hop while experimenting with diverse genres such as funk, psychedelia, jazz, and
        techno.</p>

      <p>Benjamin and Patton formed the group as high school students in 1992. Outkast released their debut album
        Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik in 1994, which gained popularity after the single "Player's Ball" reached number
        one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases including ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini
        (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial
        success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed Stankonia, which included the singles "Ms. Jackson"
        and "B.O.B."</p>

      <p>In September 2003, the duo released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one
        singles "Hey Ya!" and "The Way You Move." The album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and was certified
        Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America. Outkast next released the soundtrack for the 2006
        musical film Idlewild, which they also starred in. In 2007, the duo went on hiatus and both members have since
        pursued solo careers. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than
        40 festivals worldwide, beginning at the Coachella Festival in April.[9]</p>

      <p>The duo is one of the most successful hip hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Rolling
        Stone ranked them No. 7 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.[10] Between six studio albums and a
        greatest hits release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records.[citation needed] Meanwhile, they have garnered
        widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork Media listing albums such as
        Aquemini and Stankonia among the best of their era.</p>
